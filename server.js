const express = require('express');
const routes = require('./routes');
// import sequelize connection
const sequelize = require('./config/connection');

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// turn on routes
app.use(routes);

// sync sequelize models to the database, then turn on the server
// (turn on connection to db and server)
sequelize.sync({ force: false }).then(() => {
  app.listen(PORT, () => console.log('Now listening'));
});

// Since we set up the routes the way we did, we don't have to worry about importing multiple files for different endpoints. The router instance in routes/index.js collected everything for us and packaged them up for server.js to use.

// The other thing to notice is the use of {force: false} in the .sync() method. This doesn't have to be included, but if it were set to true, it would drop and re-create all of the database tables on startup. This is great for when we make changes to the Sequelize models, as the database would need a way to understand that something has changed. We'll have to do that a few times throughout this project, so it's best to keep the {force: false} there for now.
